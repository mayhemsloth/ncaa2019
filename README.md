This repository contains some of the data files and all the Python code I wrote to compete in the Kaggle NCAA March Madness bracket competition. Due to reasons given in the competition's rules, I will not be uploading all of the March Madness Data provided by them. I have uploaded my training data set that I compiled with the other Python scripts.
